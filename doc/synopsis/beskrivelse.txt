Project 2: Application of feature detection to (digital images of) paintings

Summary: Use methods from computer vision (edge- and interest-point/region detection) to 
determine the use of geometric methods in a large number of works of art from online databases.
In short: Find any use of the Golden mean or the Golden section if it's there.

Project offered at all levels. Basic experience with image analysis or computer vision is an advantage.
